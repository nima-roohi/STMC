STMC - Statistical Model Checker
-------------------------------

STMC is a statistical model checker that uses _stratified_ or _antithetic_ sampling techniques to 
reduce sample variance and hence required number of samples to make a statistical decision.
It uses [PRISM](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/) for loading probabilistic model and simulation.
However, it simulation engine is improved by STMC to make stratified and antithetic sampling possible.
Please visit the [Tool Page](https://github.com/nima-roohi/STMC) for 
a short introduction on stratified and antithetic samplings,
a list of related publications, and
our benchmarks.
